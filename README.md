# Knock-Knock

Knock Knock is program extension that is used inside AutodeskÂ® Revit. It is designed for editing the values of 
door instance parameters, not for changing the way your door schedule is set up. The primary way Knock Knock 
does this is by making text parameters act like Yes\No parameters. With a simple click users can change parameters 
values between multiple pre-defined values. There are more features as well.

Refer to html_help_files.zip for detailed description of what each command does.

Make sure you also download the project "pkhCommon_strongNamed", it has utility functions that this project uses.
